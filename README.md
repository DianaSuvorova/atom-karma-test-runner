Run karma tests directly from Atom IDE. No additional server or setup needed.

## Set up
- Install Package via Atom Package installer
- Open test file to Run
- Go to Packages -> atom-karma-test-runner -> run

*Currently it will run every test that karma is configured for in the project.*
*Test reporter output is not very pretty.*
Both limitations will be addressed in future releases.
